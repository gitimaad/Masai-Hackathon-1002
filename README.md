### 2. **Python-EDA_Phase (1).ipynb**
- **Description:** This notebook is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), helping to understand the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn
  - Univariate and multivariate analysis
  - Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations

---

### 3. **Python-ML_Phase_1002.ipynb**
- **Description:** This notebook handles the machine learning phase, building and evaluating predictive models on the cleaned and explored dataset.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Data preparation for ML
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Building classification/regression models
  - Model evaluation and optimization
