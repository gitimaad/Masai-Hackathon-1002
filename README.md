# README: Data Science Project Phases

This README outlines the various phases of the project, including Machine Learning, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL Integration, and Power BI Visualizations. Each phase is critical for building an end-to-end data-driven solution.

---
## 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis Phase (EDA_Phase)**
### Purpose:
To uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data to inform decision-making.

### Key Steps:
- **Visualizations**:
  - Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to create distribution plots, heatmaps, and boxplots.
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Examined feature relationships to guide feature selection.
- **Data Issues**:
  - Identified and resolved missing values and duplicates.

### Output:
Insights and visualizations that guided feature engineering and model design.

## 2. **Data Cleaning Phase (Cleaning_Phase)**
### Purpose:
To ensure the dataset is free of inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values to improve downstream analysis and modeling.

### Key Steps:
- **Outlier Detection**:
  - Identified and removed extreme values using statistical methods.
- **Missing Data Handling**:
  - Imputed missing values (e.g., using mean or median for numerical features and mode for categorical features).
- **Tools Used**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`

### Output:
A clean and reliable dataset ready for analysis.

## 3. **Machine Learning Phase (ML_Phase)**
### Purpose:
To build and optimize a predictive model to achieve actionable insights from the data.

### Key Steps:
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Transformed raw data into meaningful features (e.g., creating age groups and binning balance).
- **Model Selection**:
  - Used the Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Utilized `GridSearchCV` to optimize parameters like the number of trees and max depth, with a focus on maximizing the F1 score.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Prioritized F1 score (achieved 67.75) to balance precision and recall, considering the dataset's imbalanced nature.

### Output:
A tuned machine learning model ready for deployment.

## 4. **SQL Phase**
### Purpose:
To integrate structured querying for database management and advanced data manipulation.

### Key Steps:


### Output:

## 5. **Power BI Visualization Phase**
### Purpose:
To create dynamic dashboards and visualizations for presenting actionable insights.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Import**:
  - Imported cleaned and preprocessed data into Power BI.
- **Dashboard Design**:
  - Created interactive dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs).
  - Examples: Sales trends, customer segmentation, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Interactivity**:
  - Added slicers and filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.

### Output:
An interactive Power BI dashboard providing a user-friendly interface for data exploration.
